## Checkout

With Checkout enabled in the plugin, you will get a complete checkout in your webshop, designed and run by Vipps MobilePay.
Your customers can pay with Vipps, MobilePay, VISA or MasterCard, and they can also provide their shipping address and choose their preferred shipping method in a simple manner.
For Finland it is also possible to activate bank transfer as a payment method, with some restrictions.
VISA/MasterCard payments will be coming soon for MobilePay.

## Vipps Express Checkout

When you enable Express Checkout, your customers can choose between the regular checkout or to go directly to Vipps. If they choose Vipps, they just submit their phone number, and the rest of the checkout process is done in the Vipps app.

Since Vipps knows who the customers are, they donâ€™t have to enter all their personal information. The customer just choose the shipping method and accepts the payment. Vipps will send all the necessary info back to the store. Easy, fast and secure.

The express checkout can be done in the following ways:
* From the cart
* From the category pages
* From the product page
* From shareable links distributed by email, banners etc
* From QR codes distributed digitally or in print
	
Settings for the cart, category and product pages can be found in the WooCommerce settings for the Vipps payment gateway.
Shareable links and QR codes can be generated from the Vipps tab on the product page.

Express checkout buttons is only available with Vipps. Coming later 2024 for MobilePay.

## Single Payments

When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps or MobilePay as a payment method directly in the checkout. There is no need to go via a third party payment method. When choosing Vipps/MobilePay, user fills in name and address and is then asked to enter phone number in the Vipps/MobilePay landing page. User confirms the payment in the Vipps or MobilePay app.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### In which countries can I use Vipps?

You can only get paid by users who have Vipps. At the moment Vipps is only available in Norway.

### Does Vipps offer a test environment for Vipps for WooCommerce?

Yes, for developers that want to contribute to the development of the plugin.
Vipps does not offer a test account for normal users of the plugin.

You will need an account for direct integration with the eCom API, which can be ordered from
[*Payment Integration*](https://vippsmobilepay.com/online/payment-integration).

If you already have a Vipps account for WooCommerce and want to contribute to
the development of the plugin, contact
[customer service](https://vippsmobilepay.com/help)
to *upgrade* your account with access to the test environment.

You will also need to install a special test version of the Vipps app, available
through TestFlight. See
[Test apps](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/test-environment/#test-apps)
for more information.

API keys for both the test and production environment are available on
[portal.vippsmobilepay.com](https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com), where you log in.
See [Getting the API keys](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/developer-resources/portal/#how-to-find-the-api-keys)
for more information.

To use test mode in WooCommerce, switch *Developer mode* on. There you can input
the API keys for the test environment, and turn test mode on and off.

If you have defined the constant `VIPPS_TEST_MODE` to true, test mode will be forced on.

If this isn't practical for your usage, we recommend that you *test in production*
with a small amount, like 2 NOK. Just refund or cancel the purchase as needed.

[support forum on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-vipps).
