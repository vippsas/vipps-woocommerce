You can also do important back office tasks such as capture and refund directly from WooCommerce. Easy for your customer and easy for you.

Read [information from Vipps](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/woocommerce/) about the plugin.

# Vipps Express Checkout

When you enable Express Checkout, your customers can choose between the regular checkout or to go directly to Vipps. If they choose Vipps, they just submit their phone number, and the rest of the checkout is done in the Vipps app.

Since Vipps knows who the customers are, they don't have to enter all their personal information. The customer just choose the shipping method and accepts the payment. Vipps will send all the necessary info back to the store. Easy, fast and secure.

# Vipps Payment

When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps as a payment method directly in the checkout. There is no need to go via a third party payment method. If your customer choose Vipps, she fills in her name and address and is then asked to enter her phone number in the Vipps dialogue. Then she confirms the payment in the Vipps app.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## In which countries can I use Vipps?

You can only get paid by users who have Vipps. At the moment Vipps is only available in Norway.

## Does Vipps offer a test environment for Vipps for WooCommerce?

Yes, for developers that want to contribute to the development of the plugin.
Vipps does not offer a test account for normal users of the plugin.

You will need a "Vipps på nett" account for direct integration with the Vipps
eCom API v2, which can be ordered
[here](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/).
TestFlight
If you already have a Vipps account for WooCommerce, and want to contribute to
the development of the plugin, you can contact
[customer service](https://www.vipps.no/kontakt-oss/)
to "upgrade" your account with access to the test environment.

You will also need to install a special test version of the Vipps app, available
through TestFlight. See
[Vipps test apps](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/test-environment/#vipps-test-apps)
for more information.

API keys for both the test and production environment are available on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no), where you log in with BankID.
See [Getting the API keys](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/vipps-getting-started#getting-the-api-keys)
in the
[Getting started](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/vipps-getting-started)
guide for more information.

To use test mode in WooCommerce, switch "Developer mode" on. There you can input
the API keys for the test environment, and turn test mode on and off.

If you have defined the constant `VIPPS_TEST_MODE` to true, test mode will be forced on.

If this isn't practical for your usage, we recommend that you "test in production"
with a small amount, like 2 NOK. Just refund or cancel the purchase as needed.

## How can I get help if I have any issues?

For issues with your WooCommerce installation you should use the [support forum on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-vipps). For other issues you should [contact Vipps](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/contact).
