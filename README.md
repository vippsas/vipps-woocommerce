For more information, see:

* [Pay with Vipps for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-vipps/)

## Checkout

With Checkout enabled in the plugin, you will get a complete checkout in your web shop, designed and run by Vipps MobilePay.
Your customers can pay with Vipps, MobilePay, VISA or MasterCard, and they can also provide their shipping address and choose their preferred shipping method in a simple manner.
For Finland, it is also possible to activate bank transfer (during product ordering) as a payment method, with some restrictions.
VISA/MasterCard payments will be coming soon for MobilePay.

## Express Checkout

When you enable Express Checkout, your customers can choose between the regular checkout or to go directly to Vipps. If they choose Vipps, they just submit their phone number, and the rest of the checkout process is done in the Vipps app.

Since Vipps knows who the customers are, they don‚Äôt have to enter all their personal information. The customer just choose the shipping method and accepts the payment. Vipps will send all the necessary info back to the store. Easy, fast and secure.

The express checkout can be done in the following ways:

* From the cart
* From the category pages
* From the product page
* From shareable links distributed by email, banners, etc.
* From QR codes distributed digitally or in print

Settings for the cart, category and product pages can be found in the WooCommerce settings for the Vipps payment gateway.
Shareable links and QR codes can be generated from the Vipps tab on the product page.

Express checkout buttons is only available with Vipps. Coming later 2024 for MobilePay.

## Single Payments

When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps or MobilePay as a payment method directly in the standard WooCommerce checkout.
There is no need to go via a third party payment method.
When choosing Vipps/MobilePay, the customer fills in the name and address and is then asked to enter phone number on the Vipps/MobilePay landing page.
They then confirm the payment in the Vipps or MobilePay app.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### In which countries can I use Vipps MobilePay?

You can get paid by users who have Vipps in Norway, or who have MobilePay in Denmark or Finland.

### How do I set the default language?

The plugin should use the website language. The default is always English, and it is translated to whatever the current locale is. It's possible to modify translations and add more translations by using [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) or you could contribute translations on [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/).

### For how long is an order reserved?

:::note
Payments initiated in Finland and Denmark have only 14 days to be captured; while
payments in Norway have 180 days.
If the payments aren't captured within this time, they will be automatically cancelled.

Payments can only be captured up to 14 days (MobilePay) or 180 days (Vipps) after reservation.
See [Reserve and capture](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/reserve-and-capture/).
:::

When a payment is completed with Vipps MobilePay, the money will be reserved, but only transferred to the merchant when the order is set to ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù or the money is captured manually. For MobilePay, this reservation period is 14 days, so you will need to ship and fulfill orders before this; or to make an agreement with the customer to capture the money before this period is over. For Vipps, the period is 180 days. The reserved period for payments made by credit card in Vipps/MobilePay Checkout can be as short as 7 days.

If the order only contains virtual and downloadable products, the plugin will capture the order automatically and set the order to ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù as is the standard WooCommerce rule.

### Does Vipps MobilePay offer a test environment for the plugin?

For developers that want to contribute to the development of the plugin, there is a test environment.

You will need an account for direct integration with the payment APIs, which can be ordered from
[*Payment Integration*](https://vippsmobilepay.com/online/payment-integration).

If you already have a Vipps or MobilePay account for WooCommerce and want to contribute to
the development of the plugin, contact
[customer service](https://vippsmobilepay.com/info/help)
to *upgrade* your account with access to the test environment.

You will also need to install a special test version of the Vipps MobilePay app, available
through TestFlight. See
[Test apps](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/test-environment/#test-apps)
for more information.

API keys for both the test and production environment are available on
[portal.vippsmobilepay.com](https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com), where you log in.
See [Getting the API keys](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/portal/#how-to-find-the-api-keys)
for more information.

To use test mode in WooCommerce, switch *Developer mode* on. There you can input
the API keys for the test environment, and turn test mode on and off.

If you have defined the constant `VIPPS_TEST_MODE` to true, test mode will be forced on.

If this isn't practical for your usage, we recommend that you *test in production*
with a small amount, like 2 NOK. Just refund or cancel the purchase as needed.
