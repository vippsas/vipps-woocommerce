"By default, orders that are <b>reserved</b> but not <b>yet captured</b> will "

"by changing the status to 'Complete'. You should ensure that your workflow "
"is such that the order is not shipped until after this capture.<br><br> The "
"status 'On hold' can be chosen instead for stores using a workflow where "
"orders are shipped when the status is 'Processing'. In this case, 'On hold' "
"will mean \"order is reserved but not yet captured\".  This is a slightly "
"safer solution, and ensures that the order status will reflect the payment "
"status. <br><br>However, in many stores 'On hold' has the additional meaning "
"\"there is a problem with the order\"; and an email is often sent to the "
"customer about this problem. The default is 'Processing' because of this, "
"and because many plugins and integrations expect orders to be 'Processing' "
"when the customer has completed payment."
