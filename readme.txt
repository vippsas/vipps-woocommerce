== Description ==

*Official Vipps MobilePay payment plugin for WooCommerce. Let your Norwegian, Danish, and Finnish customers pay with Vipps and MobilePay for an easy, fast, and familiar shopping experience* 

Vipps is used by more than 77 % of Norway's population (4.2 million users).

MobilePay is used by more than 75 % of Denmark's population (4.4 million users), and more than 36 % of Finland's population (2 million users).

Vipps and MobilePay are payment methods offered by Vipps MobilePay. 

When you enable this plugin, you will choose between offering either Vipps or MobilePay as a payment method for your customers - hence "Vipps/MobilePay" going forward.

This is the official plugin for Vipps/MobilePay Checkout, Vipps/MobilePay ePayments (*Vipps Nettbetaling*), and Vipps Express Checkout (*Vipps Hurtigkasse*). Increase your conversion rate by letting your customers choose Vipps/MobilePay directly in the checkout or even do an Express Checkout (Vipps only) from the cart or a product page directly.

You can also do important back office tasks such as capture and refund directly from WooCommerce. Easy for your customer and easy for you.

Read [information from Vipps](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/woocommerce/) about the plugin.

=== Vipps/MobilePay Checkout ===
With Vipps/MobilePay Checkout enabled in the plugin, you will get a complete checkout in your webshop, designed by Vipps MobilePay. It contains regular Vipps/MobilePay payments, a card payment option for those that can't or won't use Vipps/MobilePay, as well as the ability to get the shipping address of the customer in an easy way. Read more about [Vipps Checkout here](https://vipps.no/checkout)

=== Vipps/MobilePay ePayment ===
When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps/MobilePay as a payment method in the checkout. There is no need to go via a third party payment method. If your customer choose Vipps/MobilePay, they fill in their name and address and is then asked to enter their phone number in the Vipps/MobilePay dialogue. They then confirms the payment in the Vipps/MobilePay app. Customer info like name and address is sent to the store from Vipps MobilePay.

=== Vipps Express Checkout ===
When you enable Express Checkout, your customers can choose between the regular checkout or to go directly to Vipps. If they choose Vipps, they just submit their phone number, and the rest of the checkout is done in the Vipps app.

Since Vipps knows who the customers are, they don't have to enter all their personal information. The customer just choose the shipping method and accepts the payment. Vipps will send all the necessary info back to the store. Easy, fast and secure.

The express checkout can be done in the following ways:

* From the cart
* From the category pages
* From the product page
* From shareable links distributed by email, banners etc
* From QR codes distributed digitally or in print

Settings for the cart, category and product pages can be found in the WooCommerce settings for the Vipps payment gateway.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= In which countries can I use Vipps/MobilePay? =
Vipps is currently only available in Norway (77 % user adoption in 2022)
MobilePay is currently only available in Denmark and Finland (75 % and 36 % user adoption in 2022, respectively).

= How can I get help if I have any issues? =
For issues with your WooCommerce installation you should use the support forum here on wordpress.org. For other issues you should contact Vipps MobilePay.

= Why are orders put on-hold and not processing or completed? =
This was the old default of this plugin until version 2.0. The newer default is now 'processing', but this also means that orders that are 'processing' will have their payment reserved, but not transferred to the merchant. You can still choose the status on-hold in the options screen.

If you choose on-hold, orders with this status will have the payment reserved, but not yet transferred to the merchant. The money must be 'captured' before they are actually transferred to the merchant. You are normally only allowed to do this at the same time as the order is shipped. You can 'capture' the money explicitly on the order screen; but the money will be captured automatically when the order is set to "Processing" or "Complete".

If you use the default or choose "processing", the same applies to this status: The order will be reserved, but not captured. You can do the capture manually, or it will automatically happen when the order is set to "Complete". Please note that you should ensure that your workflow is then so that the order is captured just before the package is shipped.

There is an exception for orders where all items are both virtual and downloadable: These are not considered to need processing and will be captured automatically (and go directly to the 'Complete' status). It is possible to customize this property for your needs using the woocommerce_order_item_needs_processing filter.

= Can I refund orders or part of orders using Vipps/MobilePay =
Yes, you can do refunds, including partial refunds, using the standard WooCommerce mechanism (https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-refunds/). Additionally, if you cancel an order that was already captured, the money will be refunded for the whole order. If automatic refund through the Vipps API should fail, you will need to refund manually; in this case an error message to this effect will be displayed and the order annotated.

= What is 'compatibility mode' in the settings? =
Some plugins add new features to products or entirely new product types to WooCommerce; which the 'Express Checkout' function may not be able to handle. It can be possible to fix this using hooks and filters, but if you choose this feature, express checkout will be done in a different manner which is very much more likely to work for a given plugin. The cost is that the process will be _slightly_ less smooth.

= Why is my shipping wrong when using express checkout? =
It may be that the shipping method you are using some how does not work when calculated from the Vipps app, where the customer is somewhat anonymous. However, since version 1.4.0 this problem ought to be greatly reduced, so if you still have this problem, report this on the forum and we'll try to fix it. 

If you have shipping methods that add additional information on the 'normal' checkout page they will not be able to provide that information to Express Checkout plugin, since that page is bypassed. You may be able to add those options on a different page; but you may want to remove those options when using Express Checkout.

Formerly, there was a filter used to work around this, namely 'woo_vipps_shipping_methods'. This still works, but if you use it, it will disable the 'new' shipping method calculation. You may still customize the Express Checkout shipping; the new filter is called 'woo_vipps_shipping_rates'.

To be sure, you should test your shipping methods in Express Checkout before going live.

= I'd like to use sequential order numbers at Vipps instead of the WooCommerce order-ids using a sequential order number plugin. Does this plugins support that?
Yes, though you need to ensure that the order-id's you produce like this are unique for your Vipps account, and you currently have to use a filter in your themes' functions.php file. We recommend using a prefix for your order ids, so a filter that will work with sequential order numbers would look like

`add_filter('woo_vipps_orderid', function ($default, $prefix, $order) {
    return $prefix . $order->get_order_number();
}, 10, 3);`

= Firewall ports =
Ensure *outgoing* traffic to port 443 is open. This is used to communicate with Vipps servers.

= Does Vipps offer a test environment for Vipps for WooCommerce? =

Yes, but you will need a separate account, and you will need to install a special test version of the Vipps app, available trough Testflight. For your test account, the keys will be at https://portal-test.vipps.no; you will configure these in the developer mode settings.

Contact Vipps for access to the test app. This app must be installed on a device that does not have the normal Vipps app installed, or there will be conflicts.

To use test mode, switch "Developer mode" on. There you can input the test keys from portal-test.vipps.no and turn test mode on and off.

If this isn't practical for your usage, we recommend that you "test in production" with a small amount, like 2 NOK. Just refund or cancel the purchase as needed.

* PHP 5.6 or higher is required.

== Extending the Order Management API integration ==
From version 1.10.0, this plugin implements the Vipps Order Management API, sending a receipt to the customers' app, and sending the order confirmation link as the Order Confirmation link category.  You can, using this api, send over an image and a link for the categories receipt (RECEIPT), ticket (TICKET), shipping (DELIVERY), booking (BOOKING) and a general category (GENERAL).

For instance, if you have a page or url for tracking shipping, you can add this to the customers' app by extending the 'woo_vipps_add_order_categories' filter like so:

   `add_filter('woo_vipps_add_order_categories', function ($categories, $order, $gateway) {
       $shippingpagedata = array(
         'link' => <your shipping URL here>, 
         'image' => <filename or attachment ID of your illustration for shipping here, if required>,
         'imagesize' => <for attachments, the image size to use>);
       $categories['DELIVERY'] = $shippingpagedata;
       return $categories;
   }, 10, 3);`

You can similarily send ticket information (with e.g. a QR code) for the TICKET or BOOKING category and so forth.

= Javascript filters and actions =
From version 1.1.13 you can also modify the javascript using the new WP hooks library for javascript:
 * 'vippsBuySingleProduct' - action which is run whenever a customer tries to buy a single product using express checkout
 * 'vippsBuySingleProductCompatMode' - filter which should return true or false, if true, the compatibility mode action will be run instead of the standard ajax.
 * 'vippsBuySingleProductCompatModeAction' - filter which should return a javascript function to run when buying a product and compatibility mode is on. Will normally press the "Buy" button for you.
 * 'vippsRemoveErrorMessages' - runs when Vipps error messages are to be removed.
 * 'vippsErrorMessage' - runs for every Vipps error message added with Javascript. Takes the message as an argument
 * 'vippsAddErrorMessage' - runs when an error message is about to be added. Takes the message as an argument
 * 'vippsInit'  - runs when a page with a Vipps button is initialzed
 * 'vippsStatusCheckErrorHandler' - A filter that should return function taking a statustext and an error object. It receives the default error handler, and is called when checking the order status with ajax for some reason ends up in an error.

 The cron job that checks the status of abandoned orders have since 1.7.10 restored these orders' session to check the status as correctly as possible.
It seems this may ruin the session of other active users however, and we can't have that, so now the status is checked without restoring the session.

 Updating for latest versions of WP and Woo

= 2021.06.22 version 1.7.10 =

 Integrate with Login with Vipps and provide again the "create users when using express checkout" checkbox. If you choose too, this will then create (and log in) users when using express checkout.
Only users without privileges will be logged in like that. If you install Login with Vipps, this will be set as the default choice.

= 2020.06.29 version 1.4.8 =
 * Fixed a bug in express checkout shipping calculations where cart totals could be wrong 
 * Changed license from AGPLv3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) to MIT (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
 * Added filter to remove Vipps as option in Klarna Checkout, and added a check for unsupported carts.
 * Added filter 'woo_vipps_payment_return_url' to allow plugins to add extra arguments to return URL
 * Changed display logic of WooCommerce status messages on Express Checkout screen to allow themes that rewrite these to not show error messages when they don't apply

= 2020.05.25 version 1.4.7 =
 * Support themes that use their own templating-mechanism by allowing the use of a real page ID to handle the Vipps special pages
 * Improve the race-condition avoidance code, and make it possible to implement real locking for systems that support it (open the developer settings to enable)
 * If Klarna Checkout uses Vipps as external payment gateway, ensure that Klarna Checkout is still the default payment method afterwards
 * Change order prefix to contain the sitename of the store if possible to aid with support

= 2020.04.27 version 1.4.6 =
 * More robustness and checks in callbacks

= 2020.04.27 version 1.4.5 =
 * Changed all uses of "WC_Cart" to use the main WC-cart
 * Changed the shipping callback to use the real cart from the Session; with no "temporary" cart created from the order
 * Changed cart saving and restoring for single product express checkout to use PHP serialization
 * Experimentally support the 'bundle' product type of WooCommerce Product Bundles

= 2020.04.06 version 1.4.4 =
 * Changed freight calculation to ensure plugins that override the WC_Cart's class will continue working.
 * Changed handling of signal file cleanup and deletion of cancelled express checkout orders to wp-cron to avoid problems on sites with heavy load

= 2020.03.23 version 1.4.3 =
 * Added support for Klarna Checkout based on the code provided by Krokedil at https://github.com/krokedil/klarna-checkout-vipps-external-payment-method
 * Added support for static shipping: Much quicker express checkout if your shipping method don't depend on the customers address (or if your customers are logged in.) This precalculates the shipping options before sending the user to Vipps, but be aware: All the options must be static (like fixed price and so forth).

= 2020.03.03 version 1.4.2 =
 * Tiny change to avoid logging non-errors if no shipping method has been chosen at all

= 2020.02.25 version 1.4.1 =
 * Bugfix: The template chooser mechanism caused WP_DEBUG to print out error messages if the option wasn't set.

= 2020.02.24 version 1.4.0 =
 * Properly round prices with wc_format_decimal (Thanks to Shattique @ netthandlesgruppen for reporting)
 * Ensure 'spinner' on page forwarding to Vipps is centered
 * New option in settings: Override the page template used for the Vipps special pages (choose 'full width' and so forth here.)
 * New shipping handling of shipping callbacks in Express Checkout makes shipping methods using meta data work - that is, all shipping methods that have added meta data for for instance integration with transport companies and so forth.t
 * DEPRECATION: The filter 'woo_vipps_shipping_methods' is _deprecated_ as of version 1.4.0. If you use it, it will continue to work as before, but it will disable the new Express Checkout Shipping mechanism, and thus will not support metadata in the shipping methods; which certain shipping methods need - in particular those with integration with other services. A notice will be printed on the admin screen, and an option will be shown in the settings that will allow you to silence this warning (and then everything will work as before) or to disable this filter if you prefer to use the new method.
 * New filter 'woo_vipps_express_checkout_shipping_rates' which replaces the filter above, taking the same arguments (a list of shipping methods, and order, and a cart). The format of the shipping methods is however different: They will consist of an array of 'rate' which is a WC_Shipping_Rate object, 'priority' which is an integer and the sort-order Vipps will use to display the alternatives, and 'default', which is a boolean: This will be the default choice
 * New filter 'woo_vipps_default_shipping_method' taking the default shipping method ID, a list of the shipping methods available (as a table from method id to WC_Shipping_Rate object) and the order. Return a shipping rate id, like 'local_pickup:5'.
 * New filter 'woo_vipps_vipps_formatted_shipping_methods'. This will take an array of the methods to be sent to Vipps, formatted as required by Vipps. This is mostly for debugging.
 * DEPRECATION: the filter 'woo_vipps_express_checkout_shipping_rate' will only be applied if you use the old method of doing shipping for express checkout; thus you will have to have overridden the  'woo_vipps_shipping_methods' filter too. This is replaced by the filter 'woo_vipps_express_checkout_final_shipping_rate', which takes an WC_Shipping_Rate object, the order and the shipping info from Vipps and must return a WC_Shipping_Rate object.
 * Replace use of file_get_contents with the WP http api methods, thus there is no longer any requirement for having allow_url_fopen true

= 2020.02.07 version 1.3.7 =
 * Improved error-handling in validate-express-checkout; thanks to lykkelig @wp.org

= 2020.02.03 version 1.3.6 =

= 2019.12.12 version 1.3.4 =

= 2019.11.20 version 1.3.2 =
 * Ensured free_shipping is set as default shipping method in Express Checkout if the user qualifies. Thanks to Emily Bakke for reporting.
 * When using express checkout, use the customers' phone number as default if we know it https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-woocommerce/issues/22. Thanks to sOndre for reporting.

= 2019.11.13 version 1.3.1 =
 * Added code to ensure that wpml doesn't ruin callback urls with extra slashes

= 2019.11.04 version 1.3.0 =
 * Finally, added a session handler for the Vipps callbacks so these happen with the same session and context as the user interactions. Furthermore added handling for coupons and any previous chosen shipping method in the shipping callback, and added sorting to this so cheapest appear first.
 * Changed logic of maybe_delete_order so that it just marks the order as deleted and then does the actual delete 10 minutes later. This way, hooks and stuff can manipulate the order before it is deleted.

= 2019.10.21 version 1.2.5 =
 * Added protection against too long 'transactionText' values, and a new filter 'woo_vipps_transaction_text_shop_id' which can be used to provide a short name for the store (default is home_url()). Thanks to Marco1970 on wp.org for reporting.

= 2019.10.14 version 1.2.4 =
 *  Added action 'woo_vipps_shipping_details_before_cart_creation' to assist sites where the Cart cannot be manipulated when no session is active.

= 2019.10.07 version 1.2.3 =
 * Added actions and filters when creating Express Checkout order: 'woo_vipps_before_create_express_checkout_order' 'woo_vipps_create_express_checkout_cart_contents' and 'woo_vipps_express_checkout_order_created'
 * Added a call to 'get_payment_details' before capturing or refunding money - this ensures that orders are synced with Vipps before this is done and eliminates a difficult error that previously only was fixable by pressing "Show complete transaction details".

= 2019.09.16 version 1.2.2 =
 * Ensure situations where the first and second address lines are duplicates are silently fixed
 * Add option for deleting Express Checkout orders that are abandoned (from 'Pending' to 'Cancelled' without any customer or address info)
 * Add 'developer mode' and in this, 'test mode' with a separate set of keys for testing Vipps. Remember, you will also need to install a test Vipps app from Testflight on a separate device from your normal Vipps-device.


= 2019.08.26 version 1.2.1 =

= 2019.03.11 version 1.1.13 =
* New compatibility mode for "Buy now" for products that need special configuration. You can choose this in the backend, and the purchase will be made in a more compatible manner which is _slightly_ less smooth.
* Disable "Buy now" buttons if products or cart have total value 0 - Vipps can't handle free products.
* Added support for WP hooks in javascript (with backwards compatibility for 4.7-4.9).

* Changed the express checkout shortcode methods to ignore the backend settings for express checkout - now only the cart will be verified when a short code is used
* In this version, it is possible to choose Processing as a non-captured status (with capture done either manually or on Complete), where shipping must be done after capture. This changes the status change hook usage in the plugin.
* To facilitate custom order statuses and flow, use payment status instead with only four values (initiated/authorized/complete/cancelled) to check results
* Bugs in the shipping callback for Express Checkout fixed


= 2019.01.01 version 1.1.10 =
