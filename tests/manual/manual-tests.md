# Manual tests

We currently have no testing suite for Vipps/MobilePay Recurring Payments for WooCommerce

It's imperative we test each update manually.

## Testing orders

I should be able to create an order for a subscription product and pay via Vipps/MobilePay with the following configurations:

- Physical products
    - On different intervals (day, week, month, year)
    - On a sale
    - Synchronized renewal
    - Synchronized renewal with a "Sign-up grace period" set
    - I can capture an order through changing the status to "Completed" or "Processing"
    - With the "capture payment instantly" option set
    - With a free trial
  
- Digital products
    - On different intervals (day, week, month, year)
    - On a sale
    - Synchronized renewal

I should be able to refund an order both _partially_ and in _full_.

Additionally, I should be able to refund an order _partially_ and then in _full_ later on.
